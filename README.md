Game Rules:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.

- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they whish. Each result get added to his ROUND score BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.

- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.

- The first player to reach the default 100 points (final score can be specified) on GLOBAL score wins the game.
